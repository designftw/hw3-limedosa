	<h3>Usability Dimensions and Improvements: </h3>
	<body>The usability dimensions adressed mostly usability. The original website is very hard to use and doesn't scale well on IOS. The main problem was the side bar. I changed the side bar to be navigatio  bar, which would inherently make it easier to access the website on a phone. The side bar was quite difficult to change, but ultimately it creates a more pleasing user experience.  </body>
